# DIscordBot

Here you can find my video with the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ryTfM0BL3M

A simple bot that reads the text, replies, creates channels, creates a private channel to record logs, has commands, blocks and deletes messages.

C# I used Visual Studio 2022.

Remember to add NuGet packages!
